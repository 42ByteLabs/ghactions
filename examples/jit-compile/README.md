# Just-in-time compilation

This example demonstrates how to use the just-in-time (JIT) compilation of the GitHub Action.
This is the last resort when an Action doesn't use an entrypoint script and doesn't have a Dockerfile.

It is recommended to use a Container Action with a Dockerfile or an entrypoint script verses JIT compilation.
